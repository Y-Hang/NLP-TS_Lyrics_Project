# Taylor Swift Lyrics Analysis: *How Love Story becomes Bad Blood*

This project analyzed the lyrics of 112 songs (including bonus tracks but not voice memos in deluxe versions) from Taylor Swift's 7 studio albums (*self-titled*, *Fearless*, *Speak Now*, *Red*, *1989*, *reputation*, and *Lover*). First, I stemmed all the lyrics and explored the trend of Taylor’s songs on total words and unique words. Second, I implemented TF-IDF to identify the most representative lyrics/words of each album. Third, to compare the similarity among Taylor’s songs in different eras, I employed LDA with Jensen-Shannon Distance and Word Mover’s Distance respectively and visualized the similarity among all 112 songs in terms of lyrics.
